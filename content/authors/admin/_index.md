I received my Bachelor's degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2024. 

I was under the guidance of Prof. [Kun He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YTQnGJsAAAAJ) @ HUST, Prof. [Hao Wang](http://www.wanghao.in/) @ Rutgers and Prof. [Huan Zhang](https://www.huan-zhang.com/) @ UIUC.

Here is my [CV](https://yibinwang.netlify.app/uploads/resume.pdf).

My research interests focus on **LLMs and RL**, particularly in the areas of generalization, calibration and efficient training.
