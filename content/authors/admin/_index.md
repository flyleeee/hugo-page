I am a fourth-year undergraduate in Computer Science at the **Huazhong University of Science and Technology**. I was under the guidance of Prof. [Kun He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YTQnGJsAAAAJ). Now I am interning under the guidance of Prof. [Hao Wang](http://www.wanghao.in/).

I am looking for Fully Funded **Ph.D.** Position. Here is my [CV](https://yibinwang.netlify.app/uploads/resume.pdf).

I am researching **Adversarial Robustness** of Machine Learning, in both **Empirical Robustness** and **Certified Robustness**.
